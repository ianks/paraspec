# Paraspec

Paraspec is a parallel RSpec test runner.

It is built with a producer/consumer architecture. A master process loads
the entire test suite and sets up a queue to feed the tests to the workers.
Each worker requests a test from the master, runs it, reports the results
back to the master and requests the next test until there are no more left.

This producer/consumer architecture enables a number of features:

1. The worker load is naturally balanced. If a worker happens to come across
a slow test, the other workers keep chugging away at faster tests.
2. Tests defined in a single file can be executed by multiple workers,
since paraspec operates on a test by test basis and not on a file by file basis.
3. Standard output and error streams can be[*] captured and grouped on a
test by test basis, avoiding interleaving output of different tests together.
This output capture can be performed for output generated by C extensions
as well as plain Ruby code.
4. Test results are seamlessly integrated by the master, such that
a parallel run produces a single progress bar with Fuubar across all workers.

[*] This feature is not yet implemented.

## Usage

For a test suite with no external dependencies, using paraspec is
trivially easy. Just run:

    paraspec

To specify concurrency manually:

    paraspec -c 4

To pass options to rspec, for example to filter examples to run:

    paraspec -- -e 'My test'
    paraspec -- spec/my_spec.rb

For a test suite with external dependencies, paraspec sets the
`TEST_ENV_NUMBER` environment variable, like
[parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests) does.
The test suite can then configure itself differently in each worker.

By default the master process doesn't have `TEST_ENV_NUMBER` set.
To have that set to `1` use `--master-is-1` option to paraspec:

    paraspec --master-is-1

## Advanced Usage

### Formatters

Paraspec works with any RSpec formatter, and supports multiple formatters
just like RSpec does. If your test suite is big enough for parallel execution
to make a difference, chances are the default progress and documentation
formatters aren't too useful for dealing with its output.

I recommend [Fuubar](https://github.com/thekompanee/fuubar) and
[RSpec JUnit Formatter](https://github.com/sj26/rspec_junit_formatter)
configured at the same time. Fuubar produces a very nice looking progress bar
plus it prints failures and exceptions to the terminal as soon as they
occur. JUnit output, passed through a JUnit XML to HTML converter like
[junit2html](https://gitlab.com/inorton/junit2html), is much handier
than going through terminal output when a run produces 100 or 1000
failing tests.

### Debugging

Paraspec offers several debugging aids. The first one is the terminal option:

    paraspec -T

This option makes paraspec stay attached to the same terminal it was
launched in, making it possible to insert e.g. `byebug` calls in supervisor,
master or worker code as well as anywhere in the test suite being executed
and have byebug work. Setting this option also sets concurrency to 1.

Paraspec can produce copious debugging output in several facilities.
The debugging output is turned on with `-d`/`--debug` option:

    paraspec -d state	# supervisor, master, worker state transitions
    paraspec -d ipc	# IPC requests and responses
    paraspec -d perf	# timing & performance information
